World Population EDA Project
Overview
This project explores global population trends by analyzing the "World Population" dataset spanning from 1970 to 2022. Through data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations, the project uncovers key insights into population growth, regional differences, and historical changes across continents and countries.

Dataset
Source: [world_population.csv]

Content: Annual population figures for countries worldwide (1980–2022), including rank, country names, regions, and capital cities.

Project Steps
Data Loading & Overview: Import the dataset and view the initial structure.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, format large numbers for readability, and ensure correct data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Compute descriptive statistics for population columns.

Visualize population changes over time using plots and heatmaps.

Analyze trends by continent and highlight top populations in recent years.

Detect correlations between key features.

Results & Insights: Summarize global and regional population patterns based on the analysis.
